# FA58GHZ Firmware

The firmware is based in Arduino, you can use Arduino or Atmel Studio with the Arduino pluging.

It uses the Arduino Library TVOut (https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tvout/) which is included in this folder. To install, copy the content of the ZIP file into (Arduino Folder)\libraries. The TVOut library has been modified to add the Pause and Resume functions, therefore It's recommended to use this version instead of the original.
