# FA58GHZ-VideoReceiver

This is the repository for the FA58GHZ ( FreakyAttic 5.8GHZ ) RF Video Receiver Module with the following characteristics:
- Open software and hardware platform, based on Arduino and KidCad.
- Based in the 5.8GHz Video receiver BOSCAM rx5808;  *5645-5945MHz, -90dBm , 170mA*
- 40 Channels, supporting the most commond video transmitters frequencies.
- Integrated OSD menu to handle the functions.
- Two user buttons and one acoustic buzzer.
- Multiple video inputs, posibility for Diversity Receiver ( 2 5.8GHz receivers ).
